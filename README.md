# Concrete-Quality-control-Analysis
Predicting concrete strength from raw material proportions
The analysis:
Analyze how raw material composition affects compressive strength 
Check the Influence of water content and cement proportion on concrete quality 
Determine whether compressive strength increases consistently with curing age (in days)
