# Concrete-Quality-control-Analysis
Predicting concrete strength from raw material proportions
## Aims and Objectives:
1. Analyze how raw material composition affects compressive strength 
2. Check the Influence of water content and cement proportion on concrete quality 
3. Determine whether compressive strength increases consistently with curing age (in days)
